It has been serialized in Shueisha\\'s shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its chapters compiled in 110 tankōbon volumes as of November 2024[update]. The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, as he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the \"One Piece\" to become the next King of the Pirates.\\n\\nThe manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007. Netflix released a live action TV series adaptation in 2023.\\n\\nOne Piece has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humour. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in a book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World Record for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018 and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only one that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon\\'s weekly comic chart existence since 2008.\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nSetting\\n\\nSee also: List of One Piece characters\\n\\nThe globe of the One Piece world\\n\\nFlag of the World Government\\n\\nThe world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as \"Minks\"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents of the Government, the ones who challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seek to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label \"pirate\", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals who do not submit to the World Government\\'s authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The One Piece world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers at the cost of becoming weakened in bodies of water, resulting in them losing the ability to swim. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.\\n\\nThe world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]\\n\\nArc (Saga) Manga Anime Live Key characters Chp. Vol. S Ep. S Ep.

Luffy—a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating the Gum-Gum Fruit—who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger\\'s ultimate treasure known as the \"One Piece\", and take over his prior title. Luffy sets sail as captain of the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] and is joined by Roronoa Zoro, a swordsman and former bounty hunter; Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry[Jp 16]—later replaced by the Thousand Sunny[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, scientists, soldiers of the morally ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.\\n\\nProduction\\n\\nConcept and creation\\n\\nEiichiro Oda\\'s interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series Vicky the Viking, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in One Piece; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda\\'s biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series Dragon Ball, which is one of his favorite manga.[4]\\n\\nWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing One Piece in 1996.[5] It started as two one-shot stories entitled Romance Dawn[5]—which would later be used as the title for One Piece\\'s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in Shueisha\\'s Akamaru Jump, and reprinted in 2002 in One Piece Red guidebook. The second was published in the 41st issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump in September 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda\\'s short story collection, Wanted![6] In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of One Piece, revealed that the manga was rejected by Weekly Shōnen Jump three times before they agreed to publish the series.[7] Kazuhiko Torishima, then the magazine\\'s editor-in-chief, explained that they debated for two hours on whether or not to serialize One Piece.[8] Although acknowledging that it had potential, he was one of those against the work because it was \"incomplete\".[8] But Torishima ultimately approved serialization due to Asada being so \"annoyingly earnest\" that another editor suggested both Oda and Asada would be crushed if it was rejected at that time.[8]\\n\\nDevelopment\\n\\nOda\\'s primary inspiration for the concept of Devil Fruits was Doraemon; the Fruits\\' abilities and uses reflect Oda\\'s daily life and his personal fantasies, similar to that of Doraemon\\'s gadgets, such as the Gum-Gum Fruit being inspired by Oda\\'s laziness.[9] When designing the outward appearance of Devil Fruits Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit\\'s appearance would entice one to eat it.[10] The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters\\' techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro\\'s sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro\\'s signature move is Onigiri, which is written as demon cut but is pronounced the same as rice ball in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they \"might have cut down the laughs by about half\".[11] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators \"made the anime pretty close to the manga\".[11]\\n\\nOda was \"sensitive\" about how his work would be translated.[12] In many instances, the English version of the One Piece manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeiae used in the Japanese version. For instance, \"saaa\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"zaaa\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[13] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[14] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda\\'s work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and the possible colouring.[15] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy\\'s crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in One Piece since the series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.[16]\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn 2006, Oda stated that he originally planned One Piece to last five years and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time.[17] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[18] In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of One Piece, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot.[19] In a television special aired in Japan in January 2019, Oda said that One Piece is on its way to the conclusion, but that it would exceed the 100th volume, also commenting that he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[20] When asked if the titular treasure is \"family bonds\", Oda replied: \"No, I hate that kind of thing\", mentioning the ending of The Wizard of Oz and claiming that he does not endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[21] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga would end in five years.[22] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.[23] In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year\\'s 35th issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump that One Piece was \"headed toward the upcoming final saga.\"[24] On January 4, 2021, One Piece reached its thousandth chapter.[25][26][27] In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter 1054.[28]\\n\\nMedia\\n\\nFurther information: List of One Piece media\\n\\nManga\\n\\nMain article: List of One Piece manga volumes\\n\\nWritten and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, One Piece has been serialized by Shueisha in the shōnen manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 22, 1997.[29][30] Shueisha has collected its chapters into individual tankōbon volumes. The first volume was released on December 24, 1997.[31] By November 1, 2024, a total of 110 volumes have been released.[32]\\n\\nThe first English translation of One Piece was released by Viz Media in November 2002, who published its chapters in the manga anthology Shonen Jump, and later collected in volumes since June 30, 2003.[33][34][35] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the serialization in Japan.[36] Following the discontinuation of the print Shonen Jump, Viz began releasing One Piece chapterwise in its digital successor Weekly Shonen Jump on January 30, 2012.[37] Following the digital Weekly Shonen Jump\\'s cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started simultaneously publishing One Piece through its Shonen Jump service, and by Shueisha through Manga Plus, in January 2019.[38][39]\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006,[40] until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume.[41][42] In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.[43]\\n\\nSpin-offs and crossovers\\n\\nOda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of One Piece and Toriyama\\'s Dragon Ball. Entitled Cross Epoch, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of Weekly Shōnen Jump and the April 2011 issue of the English Shonen Jump.[44] Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of Toriko, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled Taste of the Devil Fruit (実食! 悪魔の実!!, Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!, lit. \\'The True Food! Devil Fruit!!\\'),[45] published in Weekly Shōnen Jump on April 4, 2011. The spin-off series One Piece Party (ワンピースパーティー, Wan Pīsu Pātī), written by Ei Andō in a super deformed art style, began serialization in Saikyō Jump on December 5, 2011.[46] Its final chapter was published on Shōnen Jump+ on February 2, 2021.[47]\\n\\nAnime\\n\\nFestival films and original video animation\\n\\nOne Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack! was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gorō Taniguchi.[48] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka\\'s father, have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labour. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy\\'s capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armoured battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.\\n\\nA second film, One Piece: Romance Dawn Story, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of Romance Dawn.[49][6] It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the Thousand Sunny. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her \"treasure\". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help, he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally\\'s ship.

The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films and were thus usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[55][56]\\n\\nUpcoming original net animation\\n\\nIn December 2023 at the Jump Festa \\'24 event, it was announced that Wit Studio would be producing an original net animation (ONA) series remake for Netflix, starting from the East Blue story arc, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original anime series.

The manga had sold 6.7 million copies in the country.[169]\\n\\nCritical response\\n\\nAllen Divers of Anime News Network comments in 2003 that the art style One Piece employs \"initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins\", adding that the \"artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation\". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball) shines through in Oda\\'s style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in One Piece, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[170] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series\\' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[171] The website activeAnime describes the artwork in One Piece as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[172] Mario Vuk from Splash Comics commented that Oda\\'s \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story\\'s \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[173] Isaiah Colbert of Kotaku called One Piece a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda\\'s character writing, world-building and the balance between \"fun and serious subject matter\".[174] Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that One Piece is more about the world-building, adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the \"usual shonen battling\" from series like Dragon Ball and Naruto. Bashir concluded: \"While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn\\'t even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it.\"[175]\\n\\nEX Media lauds Oda\\'s art for its \"crispy\" monochrome pictures, \"great use of subtle shade changes\" on color pages, \"sometimes exquisite\" use of angles, and for its consistency.[176] Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English Shonen Jump, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda\\'s craft grew steadily. She states that \"he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,\" notes that \"interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,\" and recommends \"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets\".[177] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: \"One Piece is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.\" He praised Oda\\'s artwork as \"imaginative and creative\" and commented that \"Oda\\'s imagination just oozes all of the panels [sic]\". He also noted that \"Oda\\'s panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast\".[178]\\n\\nIn March 2021, Mobile Suit Gundam\\'s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that One Piece is the \"only manga to trust\". He praised the manga, commenting: \"Still, we are working in the same studio and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know, among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting nonetheless. And I don\\'t trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is One Piece.[179]\\n\\nAfter the release of the hundredth volume, Weekly Shonen Jump\\'s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how One Piece changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that Weekly Shonen Jump is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before One Piece, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader\\'s expectations, with the belief in \"don\\'t fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[180]\\n\\nAwards and accolades\\n\\nOne Piece was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Award in the shōnen category in 1999.[181] It was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002,[182][183][184] with the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years.[185] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in Nickelodeon Magazine\\'s 2009 Comics Awards.[186] In 2012, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama\\'s Neko Darake.[187] In 2014, the series received the 18th Yomiuri Advertising Award\\'s Golden Medal.[188] It also won the 34th Newspaper Advertising Award in the Advertising category[189] and the 67th Advertising Dentsu Award in Newspaper Advertising Planning category.[190]\\n\\nThe forty-sixth volume of One Piece was the best manga of 2007, according to the Oricon\\'s Japanese Book of the Year Action Committee.[191] The series was chosen as one of the best continuing manga for all ages/teens in 2011 by critics from About.com, Anime News Network, and ComicsAlliance.[192] The series has ranked on the \"Book of the Year\" list from Media Factory\\'s Da Vinci magazine, where professional book reviewers, bookstore employees, and Da Vinci readers participate; it ranked fifth in 2011;[193] second in 2012;[194] third in 2013;[195] second in 2014, 2015 and 2016;[196][197][198] third in 2017 and 2018;[199][200] second in 2019;[201] third in 2020 and 2021;[202][203] second in 2022;[204] third in 2023;[205] and fourteenth in 2024.[206] It ranked eighth in the 2023 edition of Takarajimasha\\'s Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list of best manga for male readers.[207]\\n\\nThe German translation of the manga won the Sondermann Award in the international manga category in 2005.
