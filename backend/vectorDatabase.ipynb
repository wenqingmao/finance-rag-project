       " '— Seth Dillon (@SethDillon) April 5, 2022\\n\\nRelated Link: 7 Key Takeaways From The Donald Trump SPAC Deal\\n\\nWhy It’s Important: Bringing Trump and other censored voices to Twitter would be a big deal for many reasons. It would bring back one of the most followed accounts of all time, could divide users on the platform and could also lead to the demise of a social media platform created by Trump.\\n\\nTrump Media & Technology Group announced in late 2021 the company is going public with Digital World Acquisition Corp DWAC via SPAC merger. Among the products under the Trump Media & Technology Group umbrella is Truth Social, a social media platform.\\n\\nTruth Social is available to users on Apple Inc. AAPL products, but unavailable to Android users from Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL.\\n\\nAfter a strong start, the app has seen a significant drop in downloads and lost several executives. Recently, Trump ally and longtime Republican political consultant Roger Stone accused Truth Social of censoring him.',\n",
       " 'One of the plugs of Truth Social was to be a platform for free speech and a place for those banned on other platforms to join. A move by Twitter to bring back suspended accounts could significantly impact the reach that Truth Social has if users and large accounts choose to go back to Twitter, which has the larger reach and user base.\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) was permanently suspended by Twitter over COVID-19 misinformation policy violations.\\n\\n“Twitter is an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth. That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them, and it’s time to defeat our enemies,” Greene said at the time. She is an investor in Digital World Acquisition shares.\\n\\nRumble, a video-themed social media platform, announced a SPAC merger in December with CF Acquisition Corp VI CFVI to go public. Rumble is built on free speech principles and has been able to land significant accounts that have been banned from Twitter and YouTube.',\n",
       " 'Trump, who is banned from YouTube, has utilized Rumble to show several of his rallies.\\n\\nTrump has yet to post on Truth Social and his children only recently started posting on the platform. Before being banned on Twitter, Trump had 89 million followers.\\n\\nIf Trump is reinstated on Twitter and immediately starts posting there, users could head for the exits from Truth Social.\\n\\nPrice Action: Twitter shares were up 27% to $49.97 on Monda and are trading 5% higher to $54.07 on Tuesday.\\n\\nDigital World Acquisition shares were down 10% to $56.94 on Monday and are down 14% to $48.77 on Tuesday.\\n\\n$DOGEDogecoin\\n\\n$0.19850.12%\\n\\nOverview\\n\\nAAPLApple Inc\\n\\n$238.651.41%\\n\\nGOOGAlphabet Inc\\n\\n$175.710.86%\\n\\nGOOGLAlphabet Inc\\n\\n$173.710.79%\\n\\nTSLATesla Inc\\n\\n$262.38-0.41%\\n\\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs\\n\\n© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Bulls will want to see buyers maintain control above 598.04, setting the stage for a potential push higher toward 599.24. Sustained buying pressure above 599.24 could signal a move toward 600.51, with 601.22 being the high bull target for today if the momentum remains strong.\\n\\nOn the flip side, if 596.57 fails as support, bears are likely to test 593.73. A break below this level could drive selling down to 592.00.

The high bull target for the day is 530.70, contingent on sustained bullish momentum.\\n\\nIf 523.91 breaks to the downside, sellers will likely target 522.57 as the next stop.

       " 'DecryptNewsMarkets\\n\\nDogecoin and Litecoin Even More Profitable Than Bitcoin, Says Mining Firm\\n\\nAmerican Bitcoin miner BIT Mining said that it is making more money mining Dogecoin and Litecoin than the biggest digital coin.\\n\\nBy Mat Di Salvo\\n\\nDec 5, 2024Dec 5, 2024\\n\\n2 min read\\n\\nCreate an account to save your articles.\\n\\nDecrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub.\\n\\nDiscover SCENE\\n\\nBitcoin miner BIT Mining has said that minting the biggest virtual coin isn’t the only business cash cow right now: Dogecoin is proving to be an even bigger winner.\\n\\nThe publicly listed firm (NYSE: BTCM), based out of Akron, Ohio, announced Wednesday that mining Elon Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency—along with Litecoin, the 24th biggest digital asset—was far more profitable than just mining Bitcoin alone.\\n\\nLitecoin was launched as a faster, cheaper version of Bitcoin. Dogecoin was created as a joke but it’s now the seventh biggest digital coin by market cap—mostly thanks to Tesla CEO Musk’s shitposting.',\n",
       " \"The two cryptocurrencies can be mined simultaneously in a process called “merged mining,” delivering double rewards for network supporters. And for BIT Mining, it’s proven to be beneficial as BTC rewards were cut in half in April in a quadrennial process called the halving, making Bitcoin mining a less profitable enterprise.\\n\\n“As other crypto miners look to diversify revenue streams in a post-halving environment, the company's expansion into Litecoin and Dogecoin has proved to be nearly three times more profitable than mining Bitcoin alone,” BIT Mining said in a statement.\\n\\nIt added that Dogecoin and Litecoin price surges are thanks to Musk’s endorsement of the cryptocurrency and President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to support the space.\\n\\nMusk, the world’s richest man, has repeatedly said on X (formerly known as Twitter) how much he likes Dogecoin, leading to past price surges. But the billionaire has admitted that he’s not actively involved in crypto, despite his comments.\",\n",
       " 'BIT Mining said it had mined 84,485 Litecoin and 227,908,250 Dogecoin since it started its self-mining business in 2021—totals currently valued at $12.2 million and $100.2 million, respectively. In the crypto space, miners work to keep a network running and mint new coins, usually via industrial operations that use a lot of electricity.\\n\\nCoinGecko shows that Dogecoin is currently trading for just under $0.44 per coin, a more than 8% rise in 24 hours; Litecoin is up by 16% and priced at $143.\\n\\nBitcoin on Wednesday hit a new all-time high of $103,679, crossing the long-anticipated $100,000 mark after weeks of resistance. The coin is now priced at $101,368, after jumping more by nearly 7% in a day.\\n\\nEdited by Andrew Hayward\\n\\nDaily Debrief Newsletter\\n\\nStart every day with the top news stories right now, plus original features, a podcast, videos and more.',\n",

       " 'Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has extended an invitation to Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to engage in a direct discussion about Vice President Kamala Harris’ tax policies and approach.\\n\\nWhat Happened: Over the weekend, Musk shared a user’s post on X, formerly Twitter, that criticized Cuban’s stance on taxation. The post alleged that Cuban, a frequent communicator with Harris’ campaign, advocates for higher taxes for the top earners in the US.\\n\\nIn response, the “Shark Tank” star offered Musk the chance to directly question him about Harris’ policies. He also asked Musk to share his insights about the Republican candidate Donald Trump in return.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Harris revealed plans to implement a 25% tax on unrealized capital gains for individuals with a net worth exceeding $100 million. At the time, Cuban appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk Box” saying that Harris has no plans to tax unrealized gains.',\n",

That's a narrative that goes into every single election cycle.”\",\n",

She also commented on the generational differences in philanthropy between older billionaires like Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and herself, and the newer generation of activists.',\n",

It eventually transformed into a global economic powerhouse in just over 40 years and is now home to some of China’s leading technology, finance, real estate, and manufacturing companies. It remains China’s biggest goods exporter and was called the “miracle city” by President Xi Jinping when he visited it in 2019.\\n\\nWhat’s Fueling The Boom? The rise of millionaires may have to do with strong financial market performance in recent years. Dr. Juerg Steffen, CEO of Henley & Partners said, “The S&P 500's 24% gain last year, along with the Nasdaq's 43% surge and Bitcoin's BTC/USD staggering 155% rally, has buoyed the fortunes of wealthy investors.”\",\n",

Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett first used the term last year to refer to a group of stocks that are industry leading, each known for its strengths in some form of technology. These players, among the most heavily weighted in the S&P 500, have helped the benchmark soar into bull territory over the past year or so and could continue to drive gains thanks to their growth prospects.\\n\\nThese top stocks are: Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.',\n",
       " \"These top stocks are: Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\\n\\nBut there's one obvious element missing from this group: a healthcare company that's actually outperformed five of the Magnificent Seven stocks over the past year. And this player also now represents a bigger position in the S&P 500 than one of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Is this company on track to become the next Magnificent Seven company? Let's find out.\\n\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\n\\nA path to the Magnificent Seven?\",\n",
       " 'Image source: Getty Images.\\n\\nA path to the Magnificent Seven?\\n\\nFirst, it\\'s important to note that the Magnificent Seven isn\\'t some sort of group or club that periodically welcomes new members. So, for Lilly to usher in the era of the \"Magnificent Eight\" or for a new stock to replace a current player in the Magnificent Seven, there aren\\'t any official procedures to follow. The investment community as a whole would have to begin referring to this group as the \"Magnificent Eight\" – or clearly and broadly refer to one stock no longer making the cut in the Magnificent Seven and another taking over.\\n\\nThere\\'s no guarantee any of that that will happen. But if it does, my prediction is healthcare giant Eli Lilly (LLY -4.73%) will enter this elite group of stocks. Lilly, gaining about 130% over the past year, has outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven except Meta and Nvidia -- they climbed more than 140% and 250%, respectively.',\n",
       " \"And Lilly has grown to become the eighth most heavily weighted stock in the S&P 500, surpassing Tesla, which has fallen to the No. 10 spot.\\n\\nWhy would Lilly make a great addition to the Magnificent Seven? Because the company's growth may beat even that of the group's best performer, Nvidia. Lilly is on track to deliver 50% growth annually over the coming five years -- that's higher than Nvidia's 35% annual growth estimate over the same period.\\n\\nA $100 billion market\\n\\nAnd driving Lilly's growth is a program with significant potential, the company's weight loss drug portfolio. The global weight loss drug market may reach $100 billion by 2030, growing 16 times from today's level, according to Goldman Sachs Research. And this forecast isn't surprising considering the trend Lilly and rival drugmaker Novo Nordisk have seen for their weight loss drugs: demand has surpassed supply, prompting both companies to ramp up manufacturing infrastructure.\",\n",
       " \"Lilly makes two drugs -- Mounjaro and Zepbound -- that doctors have been prescribing for weight loss. The former officially was approved for type 2 diabetes, while the latter was approved specifically for weight management -- both are the same molecule, tirzepatide. It works by acting on two hormone pathways involved in digestion and has produced compelling results in clinical trials and in the real world. Lilly also is developing a third candidate, retatrutide, which may even outperform these current products because it acts on an additional hormone.\\n\\nLilly doesn't depend on its weight loss drug platform alone for earnings though. This big pharma player has a broad portfolio of products as well as a deep pipeline. But the weight loss program, which already is bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, could represent an enormous growth driver over the coming years -- making this healthcare player a growth stock that could easily claim a spot among the Magnificent Seven.\",\n",
       " \"What this means for you\\n\\nWhat does this mean for you as an investor? A potential spot in this group of stocks could buoy Lilly stock for a day or two, but inclusion in the Magnificent Seven or any other list isn't what makes Lilly a buy. Its growth potential does. Considering the demand for weight loss drugs today and most likely down the road too and Lilly's work on new candidates, prospects look bright. On top of this, Lilly's portfolio of other products also is driving earnings -- and the pipeline may ensure this growth will last.\\n\\nLilly today trades for 61x forward earnings estimates, which looks expensive for a pharma stock -- but this company is looking more like a growth stock, making this valuation look reasonable.\\n\\nSo, whether my prediction is right or not, Eli Lilly is a top growth stock to buy today and hold onto for the long term.\",\n",
